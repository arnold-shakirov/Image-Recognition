# Image Recognition with Python

## Overview
This project implements image recognition using Python. The script, `imgrec.py`, uses machine learning models to classify images into different categories. It processes image data, applies a trained model, and outputs the predicted class for each image.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes and normalizes images to prepare them for classification.
- **Model Inference**: Uses a pre-trained model to classify the images.
- **Output Predictions**: Displays the predicted class label for each image.

## Project Structure
- **`imgrec.py`**: The main Python script that processes images and performs recognition using a machine learning model.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed.
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pillow tensorflow
    ```

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arnold-shakirov/Image-Recognition.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   

3. Ensure that the images are located in the correct folder as expected by the script.

4. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python imgrec.py
    ```

### Output
The script will process the images and output the predicted class for each image.

#### Sample Output:
```text
Image 1: Predicted class - Cat
Image 2: Predicted class - Dog
```

### Requirements
Python 3.x or higher
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Pillow: For image processing and manipulation.
TensorFlow: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.

### Installing Libraries
To install the required libraries, use:
```
pip install numpy pillow tensorflow
```
